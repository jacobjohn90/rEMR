## About rEMR
This is my fist MERN stack application! rEMR, or react Electronic Medical Records, is a very basic Electronic Medica Record(EMR) designed for doctors. Most EMR's appear very outdated and not aesthetically pleasing. That's were rEMR comes to play. Currently, there are 3, full CRUD models in this applicaiton. This EMR is very basic, in terms of information that the physicians can view and input, yet there is plenty of room for it to grow. In the future, I plan on adding an API call to an ICD10 database for easier coding as well as possibly adding a Patient View for the patients to be able to view their charts.

**Even though the Log-In appears to be functional, it is not secure! I plan on making the log in functionality encrypted.**
